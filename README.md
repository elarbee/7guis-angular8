# SevenGuis

This is an implementation of Eugen Kiss' 7Guis Usability Benchmark 
for GUI's implemented in Angular 8.

This is not meant as a definitive example of best practices in Angular or web development,
just an example project for anyone interested in learning about how certain concepts can be implemented.


# Takeaways
* A great feature of Angular is it's default inclusion of the [RxJs](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) library.
The timer task included here is made incredibly trivial by the proper usage of this library.
* 2 way binding for SVG manipulation (Circle drawing task) is a very powerful and underutilized feature.

# Todo
* Cells task is not implemented. I'm planning on adding this soon. 

# To Run Locally

Clone the project using git.

Run `npm install`

Install the Angular CLI tool and run

`ng serve`
#Thanks
